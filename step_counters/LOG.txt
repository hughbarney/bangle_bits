a.mag returns a value around 1.0
but even with the bangle sat still it logs noise.


  // scale to fit and clip
  var m = a.mag;
  //var v = ((m-1)*8192)>>5;
  //var v = ((m-1)*8192) >> 2;
  var v;

  if (m > 1) {
      v = ((m -1) * 8192) >> 2;
  } else {
      v = ((1-m) * 8192) >> 2;
      v = -v;
  }
  
  // handle noise
  if (v < -20 || v < 20)
    v = 0;


===================

Lets write some code to check the rolling avg of a.mag

wrote a version of accelog
determined that threshold is often offset
The peaks and troughs do not equally straddle the zero line.


Thinking about PEAK counting to determine a step.

PEAK detecting - compare 3 points.  The one in the middle is bigger than the 2 either side
DONT use clipping !

PRO - dont have to dtermine or average thresholds

CON - could be tipped over by noise.

- do need to set a min value to ignore otherwise peaks will be detected all the time.
